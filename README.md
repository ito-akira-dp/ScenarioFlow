# ScenarioFlow

## Notice
***ScenarioFlow version2*** is under development!

*ScenanrioFlow ver2* is going to evolve greatly compared to *ver1*.
The notable points are below:

+ **Even simpler** but **even more useful** structure of classes and interfaces, which supports programmers
+ Provide a **new scenario description language** ***SFText***, which is very strong tool for writers to describe scenario scripts

Please look forward to it!

English and Japanese manuals are going to be prepared.
